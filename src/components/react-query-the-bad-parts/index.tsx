    This is gonna be a quick one, almost a lightning talk really -

    ... React Query is just great ‚ù§Ô∏è. I think it's really loved by the
    community for providing a great Developer Experience and User
    Experience alike. Now I know that's a bold claim, but I have
    brought some data to back that up:
  </p>,
  <>
    <p>
      If we look at weekly download numbers on NPM, React Query has
      grown a lot this year - from 4 million to almost 6 million - a
      50% increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now those are huge numbers, but let's compare that to React ...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      which is also growing strong, sitting at 27M weekly downloads.
      Our curve doesn't look as impressive anymore, but it also kinda
      implies that React Query is used in more than 20% of all React
      applications, or in every 5th app.
    </p>
    <p>And some of those apps ...</p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      ... have millions of users themselves, like sentry, bsky or
      chatGPT, so React Query really gets a lot of exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now of course download numbers and usage aren't everything, just
      because something is used often doesn't necessarily mean it's
      liked.
    </p>
    <p>Maybe a better way is to look at surveys:</p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      State of frontend 2024 is quite new, and they asked "which tools
      have you used to fetch data in the last year"?
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not gonna nit pick that RQ isn't a data fetching solution
      like axios or fetch, but behind those, it comes with a very high
      positive sentiment: Only 2.8% of people who used it didn't like
      it.
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      State of React has a similar question around "Utilities for
      loading and managing data", and if we group that by positive
      sentiment, TanStack Query actually comes out at the top with
      just over 44%.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I'm really happy that developers seem to like the library
      ...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>... because I've been maintaining it for the last 4 years.</p>
    <p>
      My name is Dominik, I'm a Software Engineer living in Vienna,
      where I will be joining the Frontend Platform Team @ sentry next
      month. You can find me as TkDodo online almost everywhere, and I
      also have a blog where I write about React and TypeScript, and
      of course, React Query.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've written and talked a lot about why React Query is great,
      and it really is, but still:
    </p>
  </>,
  <p>
    everything is a tradeoff. Using any piece of technology is usually
    a good tradeoff if the thing we are getting in return is better
    for us (worth more) than what we are trading in.
  </p>,
  <p>
    I think React Query is really a good tradeoff for most situations,
    but of course there are cases where it might not be the best fit.
  </p>,
  <p>
    So today, I want to talk about these cases, but also debunk some
    myths I've heard about React Query that make it sound like it's
    bad when it probably isn't.
  </p>,
  <>
    <p>So maybe the talk is more like React Query - The Tradeoffs.</p>
    <p>
      So let's get started with the first point, the elephant in the
      room -
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      the bundle-size. React Query has a huge bundle size is something
      I hear often as it's largest drawback.
    </p>
    <p>Okay let's first establish what the "bundle size" isn't:</p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      It‚Äôs not what you see on npm. That‚Äôs the size that gets shipped
      when developers install the library. Yes, it's over 700kb, but
      we also ship codemods and all the sources and source-maps for
      you to better debug the lib if necessary. It's definitely NOT
      what gets shipped to the customer.
    </p>
    <p>Okay, it's...</p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      ...also not what you see on bundlephobia. It's a good site to
      get a quick overview, but it doesn't understand ESM properly
      (neither do I btw). We ship a special "legacy" build for older
      bundlers (üëã webpack 4) that isn‚Äôt as optimized, and that is
      what bundlephobia also picks up. (Any modern bundler like vite
      or webpack 5 will see the more modern ESM build). So no, that
      size is also too large.
    </p>
    <p>So where can we get the "correct" size then?</p>
  </>,
  <p>
    I like bundlejs because it builds what we export on-the-fly with
    esbuild and show its size impact.
  </p>,
  <p>
    If we export everything from React Query, we get to 12.4 kB
    minzipped. Now that's not nothing, but it‚Äôs also not a lot. If we
    care about size, we should probably use brotli compression instead
    of gzip -
  </p>,
  <>
    <p>that would get it down to 12 kb, nice.</p>
    <p>
      But that is when we really use every single feature the library
      has to offer, so it isn't the typical starting point. You'll
      usually get quite far with just a <code>QueryClient</code>, a{' '}
      <code>QueryClientProvider</code>,<code>useQuery</code> and{' '}
      <code>useMutation</code>.
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>That gets it to under 10kb - 9.63 kB to be exact.</p>
    <p>
      Don't get me wrong - bundle size is an important thing to look
      at before adding a dependency.
    </p>
  </>,
  <p>
    But the debate about what is "light-weight" and what isn't is not
    the most important one when it comes to a central tool like your
    async state manager - Especially because there's one metric that
    is easily left out - likely because it isn't easy to track:
  </p>,
  <>
    <p>
      and that is bundle size you save by code you don't have to write
    </p>
    <p>
      A library like react-query "pays for itself" because the more
      you use it, the more it saves you code that you would otherwise
      have to write yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when checking bundle size of a library, it's important to not
      only think about the immediate size it adds, but also what it
      can save you in the long run. And on that scale, React Query is
      a clear and easy win for me. Most custom solutions would likely
      be larger or would fail in edge case, because caching and cache
      invalidation is hard.
    </p>
    <p>The next myth I would like to debunk is ...</p>
  </>,
  <p>
    the fact that React Query can't even fetch on a button click. I
    get that a lot. The argument is that it's hard for React Query to
    do imperative data fetching. And it's true - React Query is
    declarative by default.
  </p>,
  <>
    <p>
      We define a QueryKey and a QueryFunction for useQuery, and it
      runs automatically:
    </p>
    <p>
      This code will try to read tasks from the cache, and if they
      don't exist, it will go fetch and cache them for us. It will
      also do a background refetch if the data is considered stale.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, so good. Now let‚Äôs try to add filtering to our Task List
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      We'll add a filter form that has an <code>onApply</code>{' '}
      callback, and when that gets called, we‚Äôd want to refetch the
      list with new filters:
    </p>
    <p>
      If we explore what <code>useQuery</code> returns, we might find
      the <code>refetch</code> method, and want to try passing ...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      ... filters directly to <code>refetch</code>. Seems reasonable,
      except that <code>refetch</code> doesn't accept any arguments,
      so this won't work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understand the frustration about this - but it's just not how
      React Query is designed to work. See, if we have a static key
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      like <code>['tasks']</code> and we'd refetch with different
      arguments for that static key, we would not only overwrite
      previously cached data, we would also run into race conditions
      that you'd get with fetching in <code>useEffect</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      React Query has solved both of these problems with a declarative
      approach - by making your ...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      "dependencies" (what you use inside the QueryFunction) part of
      the QueryKey. That means we have to store our{' '}
      <code>appliedFilters</code>
      somewhere, for example, in React State.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the applied filters change, the key changes and React Query
      will see a new cache entry and will get data for it, or read it
      from the cache.
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      This will get us from the imperative thinking: "If I click this
      button, I want to refetch" towards the declarative form of: "I
      want data that matches this state". How it changes is
      irrelevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also irrelevant how / where we store the applied filters.
      With TanStack Router...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      it's a pretty straight forward change to make a navigation with
      different search params instead of storing it in React State:
    </p>
    <p>
      This is of course type-safe depending on the search param schema
      defined on the route, and now, we get a bunch of things for
      free, like sharable urls or browser back button navigation üéâ
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      Another cool thing is that if you change filters back to
      something you've already fetched, you'll get an instant result.
      That's because React Query caches everything separately by its
      key. It's a simple document cache, which means the complete
      response will be stored under that key.
    </p>
    <p>
      So yeah, in this example, if a task is both{' '}
      <code>status: open</code> AND
      <code>priority: high</code>, it will be in both caches, because
      there is ...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      ...no normalized caching in React Query. In a normalized cache,
      every piece of data is stored once, and other parts only
      reference it, to avoid data duplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dedicated solutions for GraphQL, like Apollo Client or urql,
      offer normalized caching because they are aware of the schema
      and the relations between the entities.
    </p>
    <p>
      React Query only knows Promises - it doesn't actually know
      what's inside the cache.
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      In the long feature comparison list from the docs page,
      Normalized Caching is pretty much the only thing React Query
      flat out doesn't support. It's a pretty hard problem to solve
      and can add a lot of complexity, so the tradeoff we've chosen is
      to not support it. I think that for most applications,
      refetching upon invalidation works well and is easier to
      understand too.
    </p>
    <p>
      So yeah, if you're using GraphQL and need normalized caching,
      React Query might not be the right choice for you.
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      There is however a community tool I want to highlight called
      <code>normy</code>. It tries to bring automatic normalization
      and data updates to data fetching libraries, and it has
      integrations for React Query, swr and rtk-query, so you might
      want to check that out if it sounds interesting to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, so we don't do normalized caching because we try to keep
      things simple, yet...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      I still hear that React Query is complex and has a steep
      learning curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      If something is "easy to understand" for someone is always
      subjective - Things that are straight-forward for you might be a
      total mystery to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it's undeniable that React Query, like any concept worth
      applying, has a learning curve, and it also has an API surface
      that isn't particularly small.
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      I went into a lot of details about React Query's API design in
      my talk at the React Advanced Conference earlier this year, so
      definitely check that one out if you want an in-depth look at
      this topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just to touch on it - Tanner has a great tweet summarising the
      design-goals of React Query, where he says that ...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      @Tan_Stack Query's API is actually medium sized when you unpack
      it all, but the most important part is that you can understand
      and learn how to use it by starting with a single function that
      provides 80% of the entire value proposition first try. From
      there, the rest of its API can be gradually learned if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So while Query's API might seem overwhelming at first, you don't
      need to learn everything at once.
    </p>
  </>,
  <p>
    You can start with <code>useQuery</code> with the minimal required
    options, which will already give you a ton of things:
  </p>,
  <p>
    Caching, Request Deduplication, stale-while-revalidate background
    updates, global state management, automatic garbage collection,
    handling loading states, error states + retries, the list goes on
    ...
  </p>,
  <p>
    Then you might add a <code>useMutation</code> for performing
    updates and tying them to queries with query invalidation; that's
    already a bit more code, but you can really get very far with just
    those two (<code>useQuery</code> and <code>useMutation</code>).
  </p>,
  <p>
    And as your app complexity grows, you might want to look deeper
    into what React Query has to offer.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Maybe you want to add an optimistic update, or an infinite query -
    those are certainly a bit more involved.
  </p>,
  <>
    <p>
      And all the way on the right side of the scale, we have our
      Persister Plugins and fine-grained direct cache subscriptions,
      which are really powerful & flexible. We e.g. use them to build
      our devtools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you reach a certain application complexity, you are
      probably happy that those exist, but ...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>...the Query API is absolutely designed to evolve with you.</p>
    <p>
      So don't believe that it's necessary to learn everything from
      the start if that feels overwhelming. Yes, there's a lot to
      learn, but you can get there incrementally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay so once you've learned the API and you're thinking that
      it's actually great...
    </p>
  </>,
  <p>
    ... you might want to start managing ALL your state with it. But
    since React Query is bad...
  </p>,
  <p>
    it really doesn't want you to do that. React Query is really
    designed to work with async state - it's...
  </p>,
  <p>
    an Async State manager that knows about the need of server state.
    It knows that the data we're seeing is only a snapshot of the
    source of truth, which lives on the server. It revalidates it and
    keeps what we see up-to-date, ...
  </p>,
  <>
    <p>
      because it's also a data synchronization tool. It also makes
      assumptions about your connectivity status and potentially
      retries getting that state.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what we love about React Query, but those are all things
      you don't need when you're storing something synchronous like a
      side-bar-state toggle....
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      IF I had to write that with React Query, this is probably what
      it would look like, which is far from ideal.
    </p>
    <p>We need to:</p>
  </>,
  <p>
    1) come up with a unique key like <code>sidebarState</code> that
    can't collide with anything else
  </p>,
  <p>
    2) we don't actually need a <code>queryFn</code> because there is
    no async work to be done. We just pass <code>initialData</code>{' '}
    and update that with <code>setQueryData</code>.
  </p>,
  <>
    <p>
      3) and we need to turn of a bunch of configs to stop React Query
      from doing what it does best - managing and synchronizing async
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't easy to get right, it's verbose and it's not very
      efficient either.
    </p>
    <p>
      The split in client state and server state is very much on
      purpose, because they have different needs. So let's use the
      right tool for the right job. There are plenty of solutions
      available to manage client state, for example:
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      <code>zustand</code> - it's minimal, efficient and
      un-opinionated. We define a store with our state and actions to
      update that state. I've then created a custom hook to keep the
      same API as the previous implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quite similar solution I also really like is{' '}
      <code>xstate/store</code>
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      because it works a bit better in TypeScript and is event driven.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the thing is, there are no surprises with either one, they
      are both perfectly capable of efficiently managing that client
      state for us, so they are definitely better choices than using
      React Query for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay, so finally, the last thing I'm often hearing is quite
      funny: Why do I even need a 3rd party library to do something as
      basic as data fetching - why{' '}
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>why isn't this built into React?</p>
    <p>
      I can't really answer that because I don't work on React, but
      I've certainly felt the frustration myself that we don't have a
      first class async primitive built into React ...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      like for example
      <code>createResource</code> in solidJs
    </p>
    <p>
      But I think the reason could be that the React team really wants
      to get an API right before they ship it. As an example,
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      we're still wondering why they didn't ship context selectors -
      something that a lot of people have been requesting to get
      fine-grained subscriptions to a context.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, we'd have a <code>SettingsContext</code> that
      contains a bunch of settings, but <code>useTheme</code> is only
      interested in updates to the theme value, and{' '}
      <code>useColor</code> should only re-render if color has
      changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change itself would probably not be hard to implement - but
      they aren't doing it because the React team has a different
      vision - a place where ...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      we can call the new <code>use</code> operator inside{' '}
      <code>useMemo</code>, and React will bail out of rendering if we
      return the same values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this already composes a lot better than selectors, and
      eventually, this might lead to a place where we can just write
      ...
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      that code without <code>useMemo</code> thanks to the React
      Compiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a great vision, but it takes time to get there (so this
      doesn't exist yet), and I think with data fetching, it's a
      similar story. Everyone "just wants useQuery", but the React
      Team thinks bigger.
    </p>
  </>,
  <>
    <p>
      Suspense is a beautiful architecture where your components get
      de-coupled from handling loading and error states. It works so
      well with TypeScript too because data can‚Äôt be{' '}
      <code>undefined</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course, the vision goes beyond client-side data fetching.
    </p>
  </>,
  <p>
    To solve problems at a scale, React now spans to the server as
    well thanks to Server Components. I wish I had a quote but I
    couldn't find a good one from the React team, so I'm just gonna
    say it:
  </p>,
  <p>
    Suspense and Server Components ARE the async primitive we've been
    waiting for. And if you're able to work with a framework that
    supports Server Components, please use them, and until then -{' '}
    <code>useQuery</code>.
  </p>,
  <p>That's al I got, thank you üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>,
